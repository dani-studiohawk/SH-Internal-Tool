Procedure
Step 1. Confirm the news (journalistic first)

Decide the type of release (event, product, data story, etc.) and the unique newsworthy hook:

Local impact?

Emotional story?

Research findings?

Product launch?

Clarify why it is newsworthy: impact, novelty, timeliness, local relevance, progress, drama or conflict.

For digital PR, note 1–2 SEO keywords and an editorial link target (no salesy anchor text). Confirm with the SEO Lead if needed.

Agree publish timing or embargo and spokesperson availability.

Step 2. Draft 5 headline options; pick the sharpest

Keep it clear, sharp, and attention-grabbing.

Include one localised option (CITY) and one numbers option (data/stat).

Optional subhead: a single clarifying line.

Step 3. Write the lead paragraph

Include in 2–3 tight sentences:

The 5 W’s: who, what, where, when, why.

A strong angle or hook.

Why the story matters to the audience.

Step 4. Add 2–4 body paragraphs with evidence and context

Expand on key points.

Include a case study if applicable.

Keep paragraphs concise (2–4 sentences).

Suggested structure:

Para 2: Key details, numbers, and for data releases a one-line methodology cue.

Para 3: Wider context such as market trend, audience impact, background.

Para 4 (optional): Informational call-to-action, for example where to see the product or find more information.

Step 5. Insert authoritative quotes (must-have)

Use quotes from internal experts or third-party authorities.

Attribute properly: Name, Title, Company.

Write draft quotes for client approval when necessary.

Step 6. Add client-approved boilerplate and media contact block

Contact information
Provide:

Press contact name

Job title

Email address

Phone number (optional)

Boilerplate copy
Should include:

Company name

Mission statement

Founding year

Regions of service

One-sentence summary of products or services

Ensure the boilerplate is client-approved.

Step 7. Include Notes to the Editor (optional)

May cover:

Additional stats

Methodology details

Image rights or availability

Step 8. Format and polish

One to two pages maximum; double line breaks between paragraphs.

End mark: – END –

Avoid adjectives, superlatives, and sales copy; let facts do the work.

Step 9. Approvals, assets, and scheduling

Before publishing or distributing:

Proofread using Grammarly and ChatGPT.

Conduct peer review (mandatory at StudioHawk).

Confirm all hyperlinks, names, and data.

Validate that content is free from promotional tone.

Workflow: internal review (#dpr-approvals) → client sign-off if needed → legal/compliance if needed.

Prepare assets:

Logo, product shots, charts.

Links to supporting blog posts or data hubs.

Scheduling:

Choose send time off the top of the hour.

Avoid clashes with major news or events.

Step 10. Distribute, follow up, and measure results

Send a short pitch email with the release pasted in the body; avoid heavy attachments.

Tailor a line or two per journalist to show fit with their beat.

Track leads, replies, and placements; log live links and coverage in the Internal Client Link Tracker; update the media list.

Report outcomes: coverage, backlinks, referral traffic, social pickup. Save the release and assets to the client folder.
