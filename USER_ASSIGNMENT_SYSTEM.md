# 👥 User-Client Assignment System - Implementation Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**
I've implemented a comprehensive user-client assignment system that allows team management with role-based permissions and visual indicators throughout the Studio Hawk Internal Tool.

## ✨ **Key Features Implemented**

### **1. Role-Based User Management**
- **User Roles**: Admin, DPR Manager, DPR Lead, Assistant
- **Permission System**: Only Admin and DPR Manager can assign/unassign clients
- **Role-Based Navigation**: User Management page only visible to authorized roles

### **2. Client Assignment Interface**
- **Multiple Assignment Support**: Users can be assigned to multiple clients, clients can have multiple users
- **Visual Indicators**: Assigned clients show with colored borders and "ASSIGNED" badges
- **Toggle View**: "My Clients" vs "All Clients" toggle in Client Directory
- **Quick Assignment**: Assign button on each client card for authorized users

### **3. User Management Dashboard**
- **User Overview**: Complete user list with roles, assignments, and activity
- **Role Management**: Click-to-change roles for authorized users
- **Assignment Statistics**: Shows client count per user
- **Professional UI**: Card-based layout with user avatars and role badges

### **4. Database Schema**
```sql
-- Enhanced users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role TEXT DEFAULT 'assistant';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN status TEXT DEFAULT 'active';
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN department TEXT;

-- Client assignments (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE client_assignments (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id INTEGER REFERENCES clients(id),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  assigned_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  assigned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
);

-- Assignment history tracking
CREATE TABLE assignment_history (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  client_id INTEGER REFERENCES clients(id),
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  assigned_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 🛠 **API Endpoints Created**

### **User Management**
- `GET /api/users` - List all active users with assignment counts
- `PUT /api/users/[id]` - Update user role, status, or department

### **Client Assignments**
- `GET /api/client-assignments` - Get all assignments with user/client details
- `POST /api/client-assignments` - Assign user to client
- `DELETE /api/client-assignments` - Remove assignment

## 🎨 **UI Components Enhanced**

### **1. Sidebar Navigation**
- Added conditional "User Management" link for authorized roles
- Role-based menu visibility

### **2. Client Directory**
- **Assignment Toggle**: Switch between "All Clients" and "My Clients"
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Blue border for assigned clients
  - "ASSIGNED" badge in top-right corner
  - Team member chips showing who's assigned
- **Assignment Modal**: Full-screen modal for managing client assignments
- **Inline Management**: Remove assignments directly from client cards

### **3. User Management Page**
- **User Cards**: Professional layout with avatars, roles, and stats
- **Role Management**: Interactive role badges with click-to-edit
- **Assignment Overview**: Shows recent assignments per user
- **Permission Gates**: Access control for different user roles
